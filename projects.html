                <h1>Expense-Tracker-App</h1>
            <small>26th December, 2023</small>
            <p>Now you can track all the expenses using my Expense Tracker App which I made using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thanks to Brad Traversy video course, which helped me to get my expense tracker app</p>
            <p>
                Learnings from my #React.js #React simple project
                The idea of breaking down each block of the code into simple compenents for a small project is very good way of organizing and working on the projects
                Personally, I try to keep things organized and breaking down code in simple components has helped me to keep it organized. 
                It helped me to understand each block of the code separtely and focus on the smaller parts which is eventually contributing for the whole project. Some of the other things which I learned are how to use HTML like elements in the JavaScript code with the help of JSX
                Got a clarity on how we can write simple functions and link them with each other using Context API

                <h1>Github Finder</h1>
            <small>3rd January 2024</small>
            <p>This time, I delved into the GitHub API, and things are coming together smoothly.
            <br></br>
            During this journey, I mastered API calls, harnessed the power of Promise.all in JavaScript, and explored versatile components placement throughout the project, a huge improvement in my CSS skills and I also used Daisy UI and I have learnt many more things. The useReducer and useState hook became a valuable tool in my toolkit.
